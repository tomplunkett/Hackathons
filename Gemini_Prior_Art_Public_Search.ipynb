      "The core of the invention, as described in claim 1, is a computer-based system for formulating customized multi-party risk management contracts. The key inventive step appears to be the mechanism for pricing and matching. It involves two different types of stakeholders providing independent inputs:\n",
      "1.  An \"ordering stakeholder\" (a buyer) defines the terms of a contract, including the underlying event (phenomenon), the possible outcomes, and the specific \"entitlements\" (payouts) for each outcome. They also offer a \"consideration\" (premium) they are willing to pay.\n",
      "2.  A \"counter-party stakeholder\" (a seller) independently provides \"registering data,\" which represents their assessment of the \"likelihood\" (probability) of each possible outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system then uses these independent inputs to price the contract by calculating a \"counter-consideration\" from the seller's likelihoods and the buyer's entitlements. It then tries to match the buyer and seller by comparing the buyer's offered consideration with this calculated counter-consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will formulate a search query that captures these essential features: a computer system for trading/matching contracts, where one party defines the contract terms/payouts and another party provides probability/likelihood data used for pricing.

      "The invention's core is an automated system for creating and matching risk contracts. The novelty lies in the decoupling of the contract's *payout structure* from the *probability assessment*. One party (the buyer) defines the desired payout for various outcomes of a future event. Another party (the seller or market maker) provides their independent assessment of the probabilities of those outcomes. The system then calculates a price (counter-consideration) based on the seller's probabilities and the buyer's desired payout structure, and then compares this calculated price to what the buyer is willing to pay.\n",

      "-   **Direct Anticipation of Claim 1:** The '031 patent discloses a central processing unit that receives orders for custom instruments. Crucially, it describes that the system can *calculate a theoretical price* for an instrument using pricing models (such as Black-Scholes, which inherently uses probabilities of future outcomes). This calculated price is then used to facilitate matching between buyers and sellers. This functionality directly anticipates the core mechanism of the '479 patent, where a \"counter-consideration\" is calculated from \"likelihoods\" and \"entitlements\" to price and match a contract. The '031 system's \"theoretical price calculation\" serves the same function as the '479 patent's \"pricing\" step.\n",

      "The prior art search reveals that the core concepts of U.S. Patent No. 5,970,479 A were not novel at the time of its filing.\n",

      "This patent is the most significant piece of prior art. It describes an automated system where traders can define and trade *custom derivative instruments*. This is directly analogous to the '479 patent's \"customized multi-party risk management contracts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "-   **Direct Anticipation of Claim 1:** The '031 patent discloses a central processing unit that receives orders for custom instruments. Crucially, it describes that the system can *calculate a theoretical price* for an instrument using pricing models (such as Black-Scholes, which inherently uses probabilities of future outcomes). This calculated price is then used to facilitate matching between buyers and sellers. This functionality directly anticipates the core mechanism of the '479 patent, where a \"counter-consideration\" is calculated from \"likelihoods\" and \"entitlements\" to price and match a contract. The '031 system's \"theoretical price calculation\" serves the same function as the '479 patent's \"pricing\" step.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. U.S. Patent No. 5,101,353 A: \"Securities trading system with automated order matching\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "This patent describes an automated trading system capable of handling complex order types, specifically *contingent orders* that are dependent on the price or state of other securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "-   **Relevance to Claims:** The system's ability to receive user-defined contingent orders and automatically execute them when specific conditions are met is a foundational element of the '479 patent. This demonstrates that the concept of a computer system managing contracts whose execution is contingent on future, uncertain outcomes was well-established. This addresses the \"range of future outcomes\" and \"entitlements due at maturity\" aspects of the '479 patent's claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. U.S. Patent No. 4,903,201 A: \"Automated futures and options trading system\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "This early patent discloses a computerized method for the automated trading of complex instruments like futures and options, including multi-leg and spread orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "-   **Relevance to Claims:** The '201 patent discloses the fundamental building blocks of the '479 system: a computerized system with user terminals, a central database for storing complex orders, and a matching engine that processes these orders based on algorithms. It establishes that automated trading systems for complex, non-standard risk instruments were known in the art long before 1994.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The prior art search reveals that the core concepts of U.S. Patent No. 5,970,479 A were not novel at the time of its filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "-   The general concept of a computer-based system for trading complex, customized financial instruments was disclosed by **US 4,903,201 A** and **US 5,101,353 A**.\n",
      "-   The specific and central inventive step claimed in the '479 patent—a system that prices a custom contract by calculating a value based on stakeholder inputs (payouts and likelihoods) and uses this calculated price to match parties—is directly anticipated by **US 5,297,031 A**. The '031 patent's \"automated system for trading derivative instruments\" which calculates a \"theoretical price\" to facilitate matching is functionally identical to the system described in claim 1 of the '479 patent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the claims of U.S. Patent No. 5,970,479 A appear to be invalid in light of the identified prior art.\n",
